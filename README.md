# Quick Github Guide
To take your changes and put them on the cloud:
1. Use `git add <file>` to *stage* changes for a *commit*.  To add all files, use `git add *`.  
2. Use `git commit` to create the commit.  It will open a textbox, in which you should write a sentence describing the changes you made.  Close out the textbox to continue.
3. Use `git push` to *push* the commit to the cloud.  It will prompt you for your github username and password.

To download others' changes:
Use `git pull` to *pull* new changes on the cloud onto your computer.
